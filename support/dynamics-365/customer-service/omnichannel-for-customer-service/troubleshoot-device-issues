# Test microphone, speaker, and make a test call to troubleshoot device issues

 In the enhanced outbound dialer, you can test your microphone and speaker before you make a call. You can also make a test call to check the quality of the call.

To test your microphone and speaker, do the following steps:

1. Select the **Launch dialer** phone icon on the menu bar and then select the **Settings** icon. 
1. In **Voice settings** you can either test speaker, microphone, or place a test call.
1. The **Speaker** and **Microphone** sections display the speaker and microphone currently in use and a list of speakers and microphones that are available on your device. You can select the speaker and microphone that you want to test. 
1. Select the following options:
  - **Test speaker**. The application plays a sound. You can select **Stop** to stop the test. By default, the sound automatically stops after 15 seconds.
  -  **Test microphone**: The microphone starts recording your voice. The recording automatically stops after 15 seconds and is played back to you.
  - **Make a test call**: The following actions occur:
    - The **Active Conversation** form opens with the message that a test call is in progress. 
    - The **Communication Panel** displays the device settings and the **End call** button. 
    - When you select device settings, you can see the speaker and microphone. A visual indicator is displayed, against the device to indicate that it is connected.
